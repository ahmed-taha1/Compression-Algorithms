project that contains compression algorithms (lz77, lzw, standard huffman, vector quantization, images predictive encoding)

- project supports both running on a console or desktop app and this feature is achieved via strategy pattern to switch between presenting strategy console or UI

- The project supports multiple compression algorithms all of them implementing the same interface to achieve abstraction to separate layers and achieve scalability and change between them on the runtime based on user selection via strategy pattern and factory method design patterns.
